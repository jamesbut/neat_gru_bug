About:
The aiTools library is a pre-alpha state C++ library designed to assist with low-level prorgamming difficulties. It is licenced under the GPL v3+.

How to use:
Much functionality is header-only. To build, a QtCreator project file is supplied; alternatively, a makefile is delivered along.

Dependencies:
The library uses the C++ Standard Template Library and some parts of the boost C++ libraries, currently of version 1.46.
Neither of these libraries is supplied with the aiTools sourcecode.

Recommendation:
Because of it's pre-alpha state, usage of this library is discouraged.
