This directory should contain everything needed to run the experiments in the paper entitled: "Evolving Indoor Navigational Strategies Using Gated Recurrent Units In NEAT"

There are a significant number of dependencies and the setup is quite convoluted.

Dependencies:

ARGoS simulator: https://github.com/knmcguire/argos3 Branch: argos3mod_bug
Boost 1.67.0
OpenCV: https://github.com/opencv/opencv Branch: 3.3.1
eigen

To build:

Enter neat_gru_bug_code/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

There are also a number of handwritten file paths in the code
that one needs to change to the directory of the user

Once build one can run experiments by running:

./neat_gru_bug archive_params_fixed_training_set/ap_35.ne (GRU exps bearing)
./neat_gru_bug archive_params/ap_39.ne (non-GRU exps bearing)

For the bearing exps one must set NO_BEARING = false in main.cpp
and RANDOMLY_GENERATED_ENVS = true in ga.cpp

./neat_gru_bug archive_params_nb/ap_4_nb.ne (GRU exps non-bearing)
./neat_gru_bug archive_params_nb/ap_5_nb.ne (non-GRU exps non-bearing)

For the bearing exps one must set NO_BEARING = true in main.cpp
and RANDOMLY_GENERATED_ENVS = false in ga.cpp
